<!-- If you want to learn more about hoisting, study the chapter JavaScript Hoisting.

Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

Meaning: Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError: -->

<h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>
<p>With <b>let</b>, you cannot use a variable before it is declared.</p>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
try {
  carName = "Saab";
  let carName = "Volvo";
}
catch(err) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err;
}
</script>
