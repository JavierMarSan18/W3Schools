// When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object:

x = new String();        // Declares x as a String object
y = new Number();        // Declares y as a Number object
z = new Boolean();       // Declares z as a Boolean object

// Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.
