<!-- If you want to learn more about hoisting, study the chapter JavaScript Hoisting.

Variables defined with const are also hoisted to the top, but not initialized.

Meaning: Using a const variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError: -->

<h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>
<p>With <b>const</b>, you cannot use a variable before it is declared:</p>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

try {
  alert(carName);
  const carName = "Volvo";
}
catch (err) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err;
}

</script>
